# sudoku solver

way back when i was learning how to program, i was given the challenge of
writing a sudoku solver. that was nearly 4 years ago and i never sat back down
to try it out.

so here it is, me attempting to create a sudoku solver. no promises!

---

- `sudoku.rb` contains a solved and unsolved puzzle for testing against.
- `cells.rb` has all of the logic for creating objects and building "relationships"
- `app.rb` is the actual logic to build the board and solve the puzzle

and sad, poor, unattended `views.rb` is a printer utility that i haven't written
yet because my solution has bugs, whoops
